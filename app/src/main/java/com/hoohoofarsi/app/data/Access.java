/**
 * What is free, and what needs the full version.
 *
 * The rules live here, on their own, with no Android in sight: one place to read, one place to
 * change, and a thing that can be checked without a phone. Whether it has been bought is a
 * different question and lives in billing/Entitlement — this class only answers «is
 * this piece inside the free part?».
 *
 * The free part is a real taste of the app, not a locked shop window:
 *
 *   • the whole of درس ۱ (محلّه‌ی ما): ستایش, the story, its exercises and the poem — every
 *     page and every section review. With seventeen درس in the book that is about the same
 *     share the maths app gives away with فصل ۱ بخش ۱ و ۲.
 *   • the practice sets of those sections
 *   • one worksheet and one exam (the easy level of درس ۱)
 *   • two printable sheets, chosen by the teacher
 *   • every narration clip, since they live on the host and locking them buys nothing
 *
 * Nothing is hidden: a locked piece is still listed, with a 🔒, and tapping it explains why.
