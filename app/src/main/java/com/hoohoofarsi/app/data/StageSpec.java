 * being talked about, frames it with a glowing ring, and moves on to the next picture in turn —
 * the way a teacher's finger moves across the book on the desk.
 *
 * Rectangles are in thousandths of the page: {x1, y1, x2, y2}, origin at the top-left corner.
 * LessonStageView draws and animates them from app/src/main/assets/book/pNNN.webp.
